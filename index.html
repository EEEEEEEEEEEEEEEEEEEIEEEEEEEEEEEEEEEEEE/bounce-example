<p>Hi! This is a prototype application that let's you login with Ricochet! Simply enter your Ricochet Id to receive a code.</p>

<form action="login">
<label for="address"><strong>ricochet:</strong></label><input name="address"/>
<input type="submit" value="login!"/>
</form>

<h1>What is Bounce?</h1>

<p><strong>Bounce</strong> is an experimental authentication prototype. Bounce
uses <a href="https://ricochet.im">Ricochet</a> as a means to offer authenticated 
pseudonyms!</p>

This has several advantages over traditional user management solutions:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymity</strong> - Using the power of Ricochet and Tor, the user can
    disassociate themselves from the account, without having to setup an anonymous
    email account - which is often fraught with difficulties.</li>
    <li><strong>No Passwords</strong> - Authentication is provided through the authentication properties of Tor
    Hidden Services (through Ricochet). Of course, there is nothing to stop someone extending Bounce
    to also ask for another authentication factor! Which brings us to...</li>
    <li><strong>Decentralization</strong> - Anyone can run a Bounce server, allowing users to pick
    and choose which entities get to know which of their ricochet addresses. Sites
    do not have to rely 3rd party providers to allow a consistent user experience across different
    sites.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How does Bounce Work?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/bounce-screen.png"/></p>

<p><strong>Bounce</strong> is fairly simple. First the user is asked for a 
ricochet id. Bounce then constructs an encrypted token and sends a message
to the ricochet id. Finally the user copies that id back to the site, and
the site valids that the token is valid</p>

<h1>Is the Source Code Available?</h1>

<p>Sure, the source code for Bounce is available at <a href="https://github.com/s-rah/bounce"/>GitHub</a></p>

<p>Bounce is based on <a href="https://github.com/s-rah/go-ricochet"/>go-ricochet</a></p>
