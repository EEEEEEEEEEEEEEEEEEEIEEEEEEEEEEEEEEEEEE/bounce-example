<p>Awesome! You Logged In. If you got this far then it's clear you like
privacy and anonymity...if that is the case then we should probably be friends!
Please don't hesistate to contact me <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahJamieLewis">@SarahJamieLewis</a> about
project ideas and the like!</p>

<p>P.S. If you never use Bounce again I promise never to use this ricochet association to bother you (if you want to connect you can find my public one in my twitter profile). If you want to be super-sure you can use Ricochet to block Bounce going forward - that will prevent annoying messages if other people
use your id in Bounce.</p>
